	<h2>More about Robo-advisor</h2>
	<p>Robo-advisors differ in the type of account, investment products, and additional services offered. The use of AI further improves the functionality of robos.</p>

	<details>
	<summary>Type of account</summary>
	<p>Robo-advisors can allow their retail clients to open various types of accounts on their platforms to serve different purpose, for example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pension savings</li>
  		<li>Security trading</li>
  		<li>College savings</li>
  		<li>Tax-sheltered investment</li>
  		<li>Insurance</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Some robos also offer services for institutions sponsoring pension plans. These platforms typically do not provide advice relating to decumulation</p>
	</details>

	<details>
	<summary>Investment products</summary>
	<p>While many robo-advisors offer ETFs exclusively, some also offer other options, such as direct investment in indices.</p>
	<p>Some robo-advisors have partnered with specific product providers, and others act as proprietary distribution channels of large asset managers whose products would be favoured for selection.</p>
	</details>

	<details>
	<summary>Investment recommendation</summary>
	<p>Other than investment goal and the time horizon of investment, some platforms offer recommendations based on a more comprehensive view of the individual's particular financial situation 
	as well as current events which may require some level of manual management. </p>
	<p>Algorithms will generate a recommended asset allocation based on the inputs. Investors may adjust the portfolio on some platforms, institutional clients may even be able to select the algorithm applied. </p>
	<p>Pre-defined strategies and social trading (investors can copy the strategies of others or be copied themselves and be compensated) are sometimes available as well.</p>
	<p>On some platform, suggestions for the investor may not be not automatically executed.</p>
	</details>
	
	<details>
	<summary>Additional services</summary>
	<p> Some platforms provide services other than investment recommendations, here are some examples:</p>
	<ul>
  		<li>Maintain desired level of risk and automatic reinvestment of dividends</li>
 		<li>Tax-loss harvesting algorithms for tax reporting purposes</li>
  		<li>Suggestions to meet specific goals (e.g., additional deposit for pension savings)</li>
  		<li>Automatically generated reports or alerts to fulfill regulatory requirements</li>
	</ul>
	</details>
	
	<details>
	<summary>Pricing structure</summary>
	<p>Typically, these platforms generate revenues from management fees, expense fees, charging for complementary services, retrocession and rebates.</p>

	<h3>Benefits</h3>
	<ul>
  		<li><b>Affordable:</b> saving time on analyzing and monitoring investments, promoting financial inclusion</li>
  		<li><b>Accessible:</b> offer flexibility of access at any time and anywhere</li>
  		<li><b>Objective:</b> free from behavioral bias of human advisors</li>
  		<li><b>Consistent:</b> standardized profiling results in consistent recommendations</li>
  		<li><b>Transparent:</b> clear reasoning/logic behind every recommendation</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Challenges</h3>
	<ul>
  		<li><b>Difficult to define the scope or regulation and advice:</b> robo-advisor is a broad term that refers to any platform with any level of automated management services.</li>
  		<li><b>Conflict of interest:</b> platforms may have incentives to recommend their own products or accept retrocessions and other payments from third parties relating to the funds or trading activities</li>
  		<li><b>Robustness and transparency of algorithms:</b> Procedures need to be in place to ensure proper oversight of the development of the algorithms, thorough auditing, and testing for resilience 
		in extreme scenarios as well as mechanisms to allow consumer access to redress in the event that the algorithms fail.</li>
  		<li><b>Consumer disengagement:</b> consumers may not take the time to understand how it works or to consider the assets underlying the investment due to high level of automation</li>
  		<li><b>Systemic risk and pro-cyclicality:</b> algorithms used by robo-advisors recommend very similar investment strategies leading to herd behaviour and move the market (not a big concern for now)</li>
	</ul>
