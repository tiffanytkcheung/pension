	<h2><u>Factors affecting perceived saving adequacy - studies in HK, Netherlands, US</u> <sup><a href="#fn5">5</a> </sup><sup><a href="#fn6">6</a> </sup><sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup></h2>
	
	<div style="margin-left: 100px;"><img src="model.PNG" alt="Interdisciplinary financial planning model" width="600" height="350"></div>
		
	<details>
	<summary><h3>Psychological Dispositions</h3></summary>
	<p>Individual saving decisions are affected by one's cognitive capabilities, the ability to plan over time, and the perseverance required to carry out those long-range plans.
	<ul>
		<li>Future time perspective</li>
		<li>Retirement goal clarity</li>
		<li>Level of financial knowledge</li>
	</ul>
	The average level of future orientation was not only stronger in the USA than in The Netherlands, but it was also more strongly related to Americans' perceptions of savings adequacy than among the Dutch. 
	Thinking about the future and saving for retirement are two separate issues in The Netherlands, whereas these issues are clearly linked in the USA.</p>
	</details>

	<details>
	<summary><h3>Social Forces</h3></summary>
	<p>Individual saving decisions are shaped by the social context in which they are made.
	<ul>
		<li>Spouse or partners</li>
		<li>Friends and co-workers</li>
		<li>Early parental socialisation</li>
	</ul>
	The effect of social support is more indirect. Spouses influence planning practices by extending one's time perspective further into the future. 
	The support of friends and colleagues is likely to impact on the clarity of an individual's retirement goals.</p>
	</details>

	<details>
	<summary><h3>Institutional Forces</h3></summary>
	<p>Individual saving decisions are shaped by the quality and design of pension institutions.
	<ul>
		<li>Trust in government</li>
		<li>Trust in banks / fund managers / insurance companies</li>
		<li>Trust in employer pension</li>
	</ul>
	Structural differences in employer and state pensions in the Netherlands and United States lead to very different <b>saving pressures</b> on the 
	individual worker. Private pension may force workers to think about (if not actually save for) their future retirement. A lack of trust in the government 
	may provide strong incentives to save by <b>motivating individuals to fend for themselves in the retirement financing arena</b> while the positive 
	relationship found between <b>trust in one's employer pension and perceived savings adequacy was much stronger among the Dutch</b>, which is 
	unexpected (when trust in a governmental pension is high and retirement resources needs are expected to be relatively low).</p>
	</details>
	
	<p>**some simple demographic information (e.g. age, marital status, education level) is also studied.</p>

	they are very likely to regret not saving enough and cannot retire earlier. 
	<ul>
		<li>More than 40% of working respondents believe their <a href="https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/us/en/institutions/market-insights/gsam-insights/2022/retirement-survey-insights-2022.html">savings are behind schedule</a>. The younger respondents are more likely to report their savings are ahead of schedule. </li>
		<li>Nearly three quarters of working respondents plan for too little retirement income. </li>

Low proportion of equity investment was observed across all generation in Canada.

	<p>Due to higher life expectancy, more savings have to be accumulated to maintain one's pre-retirement living standard during a longer retirement. <a href="https://www.ubs.com/ch/en/private/pension/pension-gap-index.html">Model</a> estimates that countries with higher retirement age allow individuals to accumulate more wealth through retirement plan such that more of the salary can be used on pre-retirement daily expenses.

	<p>Majority of the respondents in UK, US, Australia and Canada have indicated the preference to delay retirement.

	<p><a href="https://crr.bc.edu/how-well-do-people-perceive-their-retirement-preparedness/">CRR paper</a> also states that homeowners, when their home represents a much higher portion of their total net worth, are more likely to be "too worried" because they do not plan to tap their home equity to support general consumption in retirement. The use of reverse mortgages for funding retirement is also not widely anticipated (11%) among homeowners, downsizing is much more popular (48%).<sup><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup> The feeling of losing the property might be a reason.</p>
	</details>

	<details>
	<summary><h3>Individual level of debt</h3></summary>
	<p>Repaying debt is often a more immediated financial needs and the debt level sometimes associates with financial literacy as well.</p>
	</details>

	<details>
	<summary><h3>Conflicting saving needs</h3></summary>
	<p>Saving for retirement is complicated by managing other more immediate financial needs (e.g.loans, finacial support for family, time out of workforce) especially among younger generations. Both surveys by <a href="https://www.ifec.org.hk/web/common/pdf/about_iec/financial-literacy-monitor-2021.pdf">IFEC</a> and <a href="https://www.pori.hk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Press_releaseHKDPB_announces_findings_of_its_fourth_Hongkongers.pdf">PORI</a> agree with this. <sup><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Close to half of respondents report at least once in their career the need to <a href="https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/us/en/institutions/market-insights/gsam-insights/2022/retirement-survey-insights-2022.html">stop saving for retirement due to financial hardship</a>.</li>
		<li>One-third (33 percent) of workers and one-quarter (26 percent) of retirees, especially those who consider debt to be a major problem, agree that retirement savings is not a priority relative to the current needs of their family.<sup><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup></li>
	</ul>
	</details>

	<details>
	<summary><h3>Employment and participation in retirement plan</h3></summary>
	<p>Among those who are saving or intend to save, two in five (40 percent) workers globally cite employment reasons (i.e. employer started paying into a retirement plan, automatically enrolled into their employer's plan, employer offered a matching contribution to their plans) being a factor that prompted them to save.<sup><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup></p>
	<p>Individual's savings and investments amount was found to be positively related to the participation in retirement plan.<sup><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup> Countries that don't require high personal savings rate usually have either high tax rate or retirement plan mandatory contribution rate to support a high pension payout in retirement.<sup><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup> The absence of auto-enrolment to workplace pension in Germany may contribute to the <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eumultisitev4prod-live-eb461540d2184169bb77db2b062d9318-f268f99/global-wi/pdfs/global-retirement-survey-report-15062020.pdf">low score of readiness</a> across all ages and income groups.</p>
	<p>Young workers in HK score significantly higher than older groups due to higher contribution from retirement savings. Rising awareness from the introduction of MPF is likely to be one of the reasons.</p>

	<summary><h3><a href="https://crr.bc.edu/how-well-do-people-perceive-their-retirement-preparedness/">Continue decline in interest rate & slower global economic growth</a></h3></summary>
	<p>Over a decade of low-interest rate and low portfolio return (slower growth due to pandemic and rising interest rate) makes it hard for individuals to accumulate enough savings for retirement through low-risk investments and may even suffer from losses.

	<p>If future retirees cannot rely on social security to the same extent as previous generations due to reduction in public retirement benefit, this means that personal engagement, 
	action, and a sense of ownership and accountability is of paramount importance. This is a critical in countries providing state pension especially those giving unsustainably generous payout e.g. Germany and Switzerland.</p>

	<p>The report evaluates retirement readiness through studying the gap between living cost and income in retirement of an average Jane, who is a 50-year-old (in 2020) single woman earning median wage and hasn't yet planned for retirement, in the major city of 24 jurisdictions.</p>
	<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="pension_gap.PNG" alt="UBC pension gap" width="800" height="500"></div>
	<p>The above graph shows the percentage of disposable income Jane needs to save starting from age 50 in addition to pension plan contribution in order to maintain her current basic urban lifestyle in retirement in different jurisdiction. The calculation is based on the assumption that the savings and the pension  capital is invested.
	<ul>
		<li>0-20%: start retirement saving at 50 may work</li>
		<li>20-50%: manageable if one starts young (saving rate may not be possible in cities with high living cost)</li>
		<li>>50%: save as you go</li>
	</ul>
	*the index is time-specific as economic conditions changes </p>
