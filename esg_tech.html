	<h2>Why ESG in pension system</h2>
	<p>In general, most of the reports/researches are optimistic towards ESG investing. ESG indexes are not performing worse than its conventional counterparts in terms of return, volatility, and resistance to large drop</p>

	<ul> 
		<li><b>Risk management:</b> pension plans' long horizons render them particularly vulnerable to many long-lived ESG risks e.g. reputation, human-capital, litigation, regulation, corruption, climate...
		<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
		<ul> 
			<li>Funds could suffer from losses if not prepared for the low-carbon transition of the global economy in a time with increasing number of ESG policy (regulatory pressure).</li> 
			<li>Pension providers are expected to deliver returns over many decades, if not infinitely. The returns they seek can only come from a system which supports the funds' engagement with 
			systemic risks and challenges beyond the near term.</li> 
		</ul> 
		</li> 
		<li>Intergenerational equity or justice</li> 
		<li><b>Universal ownership:</b> as the degree of cross-sectional ownership of the economy - through diversified, global and long-term portfolios - is higher, large-asset owners have an increased 
		interest in reducing market systemic risk and externalities presented by sustainability challenges to improve financial performance overall.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>
		<ul> 
			<li>If a pension fund is large enough, it can influence company policy and the market on ESG adoption and promote sustainability 
			(<a href="https://repository.upenn.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/19573e44-3b6c-47f7-b3df-aede318ee4bd/content">case study in Norway</a>).</li> 
			<li>Systems with high fragmentation of asset e.g. 401(k) face greater challenge in developing sustainable investment practices (low PRI coverage).</li> 
		</ul>

	</div>
	<p>Remarks:
	<br>- Impact investing is less focused on returns and more focused on intent
	<br>- most ESG funds in HK use either screening or thematic approach</p>

	<summary><b>Key findings from <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication/pdfs/survey-investors-retirement-savings-esg.pdf">2022 Survey of Investors, Retirement Savings, and ESG</a></b></summary>
	<ul>	
		<li>Young investors express high concern about environmental and social issues, older investors have almost the exact opposite views; preferences are reflected in their investments</li>
		<li>Younger investors with very high investment balances express the most support for ESG initiatives, while support among those with little savings is much lower; the views of older investors are 
		uniformly opposed to ESG without regard to their savings</li>
		<li>The average Millennial and Gen Z investor says they are willing to lose between 6 and 10 percent of their investment dollars to support ESG causes while the average Baby Boomer is unwilling to lose anything</li>
		<li>Young investors are more optimistic towards future stock market (expecting over 15% of return on average) compared to older investors (10.7%)</li>
	</ul>
	</details>

	<h2>Concerns over ESG investing</h2> 
	
	<details>
		<summary><b>Lower diversity:</b> The traditional fiduciary approach to investing prioritizes maximizing returns and virtually nothing else. By contrast, ESG investing narrows the pool of potential companies in which to invest 
		(divest from particular companies for social reasons).<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></summary>
	</details>
		
	<details>
		<summary><b>Lower return:</b> State mandates around ESG led to marginally lower pension returns. Part of the reason is that the fees in the ESG funds are roughly 80 basis points higher than their Vanguard counterparts, 
		which may reflect the additional resources required to perform the screening.<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></summary>
		<ul>
			<li>Providing low-cost products causes the <a href="https://repository.upenn.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/af20c3c4-98c3-44e3-90eb-3aeeff9d82aa/content">lack of incentive</a> for pension 
			provider to work on sustainable investment.</li>
			<li>Putting <a href="https://repository.upenn.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/e8488fc3-f964-4bc2-9549-d9bcbcbd195b/content">too much weights on non-financial objectives</a> due to regulatory 
			pressure could lead to underperformance especially for public institutional investors.</li>
			<li>Theory suggests that ESG-constrained strategies should display lower risk-adjusted performance because a more constrained optimum is ex-ante dominated by a less constrained optimum while 
			empirical studies show contrasted results on ESG investing, including both positive and negative impacts on risk-adjusted performance.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></li>
			<li>The vast majority of investors would accept no more than one percentage point less in investment returns for pursuit of ESG goals; nearly half were unwilling to accept any reduction in returns.
			<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup></li>
		</ul>
	</details>
		
	<details>
		<summary><b>Difficult to standardise ESG scoring system which implies that prices may not fully incorporate ESG performance:</b> the correlation in ESG ratings among five prominent agencies (KLD, Sustainalytics, Video-Eiris, 
		Asset4, and RobecoSAM) is 0.61 on average, compared to a correlation between credit ratings from Moody's and S&P's of 0.99.<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup></summary>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://academic.oup.com/rof/article/26/6/1315/6590670#380620657">Different beneficiaries value ESG factors differently</a> (e.g. one may accept lower returns for fossil-free but 
			not firearms-free investments, while another may accept lower returns 
			for terror-free but not fossil-free investments).</li>
			<li>The concept of ESG risk is more blurred since it mixes three dimensions, there are many ways to consider whether or not an asset is ESG-friendly.<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup></li>
			<li>Sources of <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/en/the-business-case-for-esg-investing-for-pension-and-sovereign-wealth-funds">rating divergence</a>:
			<ul> 
				<li>Scope of factors and attributes considered diverges between ratings agencies.</li> 
				<li>Weight placed on different factors and attributes diverges between ratings agencies.</li> 
				<li>Indicators or metrics used to measure or to proxy attributes and factors diverge among ratings agencies.</li> 
			</ul>
			</li> 
		</ul> 
	</details>
		 
	<details>
		<summary>Completing ESG regulatory reporting and compliance and maintaining effective ESG data management are costly due to complex and non-standardised ESG data.<sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup></summary>
		<ul> 
			<li>Need to obtain huge amount of data from various sources to eliminate bias.</li>
			<li>Many funds choose to partner with a technology firm that specializes in data management to perform these functions.</li>
		</ul> 
	</details>
		 
	<details>
		<summary><b>Not enough focus on "S" and "G":</b> the three factors work better when consider together but majority of ESG funds registered under SFC focus on environmental factors.</summary>
	</details>

	<details>
		<summary><a href="https://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SLP74.pdf">Stock selection</a> is unlikely to affect the price of either the "good" or the "bad" companies from both theory and empirical perspectives, 
		therefore is unlikely to stop undesirable behaviour.</summary>

	<h2>Why Tech?</h2>
	<p>Given the ongoing rapid growth in data, a more efficient way of solving problem is necessary. AI models are different because they are able to adapt to changing market circumstances on their own with far less human supervision and intervention. 
	Quant managers have developed algorithms that gather and fine tune data, then autonomously change the investment course when a new pattern is identified.<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup></p>

	<h2>Current challenges or concerns</h2>
	<ul> 
		<li>Black box of AI-based trading strategy
		<ul> 
			<li><a href="https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/insights/all-insights/artificial-intelligence-sweeps-hedge-funds.html">XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence)</a>: while pure performance is attractive, 
			most investment management firms and investors want to be able to fully explain how results are generated before they run with real money, especially for pension funds.</li> 
			<li>How AI works will remain opaque to fund outsiders even with XAI due to protection of firms' proprietary intellectual capital.</li> 
		</ul> 
		</li> 
		<li>Lack of highly skilled talents in AI (financial applications).</li> 
		<li>Less educated and less well-paid workers might be excluded from technological progress.</li> 
		<li><a href="https://www.oecd.org/finance/private-pensions/Financial-markets-insurance-pensions-digitalisation-and-finance.pdf">Data security</a> as well as consumer protection issues relating to the suitability of 
		the services and products offered
		<ul> 
			<li>AI might be used to identify cybersecurity threats.</li> 
		</ul> 
		</li> 
		<li>The use of technology relies heavily on data quality. Poor data quality can lead to inaccurate analysis and decision-making, which can have negative consequences for pension funds and their members.</li> 
		<li>Providers could face <a href="https://www.oecd.org/finance/private-pensions/Financial-markets-insurance-pensions-digitalisation-and-finance.pdf">liability risks</a> if there is a discrepancy between the framing of the 
		printed information and the electronic information.</li> 
		<li>Incumbent pension providers are in disadvantage competing with non-regulated new entrants as changing or replacing exiting IT infrastructure is expensive (UBS spent USD 1 billion in redesigning their operation process in UK) 
		while outsourcing to specialised providers, for example enhanced analytics companies, who may fall outside the scope of pensions regulators could impose risks.</li> 
		<li>Consumers may place too much trust in technological solutions and expose to excessive risks
		<ul> 
			<li>Not reviewing their investment regularly or not updating their information when there is change financial situation.</li> 
		</ul>
