	<h3><a href="https://www.mercer.com/insights/investments/market-outlook-and-trends/mercer-cfa-global-pension-index/">Mercer CFA Global Pension Index</a></h3>

	<ul style="list-style-type: '**'">
  		<li>Detailed explanation and calculation of every sub-index as well as the grading mechanism are provided in the report which is pretty comprehensive and useful for international comparison</li>
  		<li>Adequacy and Sustainability are mentioned in almost all report when talking about pension system evaluation</li>
  	</ul>

	<p><b><u><mark>Adequacy</mark></b></u>
	<br>The system can provide benefits sufficient<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> to prevent old-age poverty and a reliable means to smooth consumption for the vast majority of the population.
	<br>Other than <b>net replacement rate</b><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, the following six broad topics each represents a feature that will improve the likelihood that adequate retirement benefits are provided:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Taxation support:</b> whether the government provides any incentives to encourage average-income earners to save for retirement and tax-exemption for retirement investment return</li>
		<li><b>Preservation:</b> whether the private pension system permits the undesirable leakage of accumulated benefits from the system before retirement</li>
		<li><b>Vesting and portability:</b> what happens to the individual's accrued benefit when they change employment; is the value normally maintained in real terms</li>
		<li><b>Retirement benefit design:</b> whether the benefit is delivered in lump-sum or annuity, and any incentives or rules that encourage the taking of income streams</li>
		<li><b>Separation:</b> Upon a couple's divorce or separation, are the individuals' accrued pension assets normally taken into account in the overall division of assets?</li>
		<li><b>Continued accrual:</b> is there requirement for benefits to continue to accrue when a worker is temporarily out of the workforce due to parental leave, ill health, disability, childcare, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As the World Bank notes, the fourth pillar can play an important role in providing financial security in retirement. These indicators cover the <b>rate of household savings</b>, the <b>level of household debt</b> and the <b>level of home ownership</b>.
	<br>The <b>percentage of investments held in growth assets</b> (including equities and property) is used to evaluate long term investment return.</p>

	
	<p><b><u><mark>Sustainability</mark></b></u>
	<br>The system is financially sound and can be maintained over a foreseeable horizon. This sub-index brings together several measures that affect the sustainability of current programs:</p> 
	<ul> 
		<li>State pension age</li> 
		<li>Opportunity for phased retirement</li> 
		<li>Labour force participation rate among older workers</li> 
		<li>Contribution rates</li> <li>Level of pension assets</li> 
		<li>Coverage of the private pension system</li> 
		<li>Real economic growth over the long term (significant impact on employment, saving rates and investment returns)</li> 
		<li>The relevance of ESG factors on investment policies</li> 
		<li>Level of government debt and public pension expenditure</li> 
	</ul>

	<p><b><u>Integrity</u></b>
	<br>As most systems rely on private pensions to play an increasingly important role in the provision of retirement income, it is critical that the community has confidence in the ability of private-sector pension providers to deliver retirement benefits over many years into the future.
	This sub-index therefore considers the <b>role of regulation and governance</b>, the <b>protection provided to plan members from a range of risks</b> and the <b>level of communication provided to individuals</b>.
	<br><b>Worldwide Governance Indicators</b> published by the World Bank provides a broader perspective of governance within each country.
	<br><b>Administrative efficiency (Cost)</b> is also an important contributor to the long-term confidence of members. Keeping the cost of scheme administration, such as collection of contributions, payment of benefits and investment management, as low as possible.</p>

	<br>

	<h3><a href="https://www.mpfa.org.hk/eng/anni_publication/towards_retirement_security.pdf">Other indicators suggested by World Bank and OECD</a></h3>
	<p><b>Affordability</b>
	<br>The system is within the financial capacity of individuals and society and does not have untenable fiscal consequences.</p>

	<p><b>Equitability</b>
	<br>The system can provide income redistribution from the rich to the poor, and this redistribution is consistent with societal preferences.</p>

	<p><b>Predictability</b>
	<br>The system can provide predictable benefits if:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>the benefit formula of DB schemes is specified by law and is not subject to the discretion of policymakers</li>
		<li>the formula of DB schemes is designed to protect individuals from inflation and wage adjustments prior to retirement or the investment policy of DC schemes can protect members from material effects on benefits from asset price adjustments prior to retirement</li>
		<li>the benefit is indexed during retirement so as to protect members from inflation risk</li>
	</ol>

	<p><b>Robustness</b>
	<br>The system has the capacity to withstand major shocks, including those related to economic, demographic and political changes.</p>

	<p><b>Coverage</b>
	<br>How much of the labour force is covered by the pension system including both mandatory and voluntary schemes? </p>

	<p><b>Work incentives</b>
	<br>Minimizing the distortions of the system on individuals' willingness to participate in the labour market and encouraging people to work longer. </p>

	<p><b>Diversification </b>
	<br>Having diversified retirement savings across different pillar systems, providers or administrators (public and private) and modes of financing (PAYG and funded), and measures to ensure security of benefits in the face of different risks and uncertainties (e.g. solvency risk for DB schemes).</p>

	<h3><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/employment-and-social-inclusion-indicators/social-protection-and-inclusion/pension">EU OMC</a></h3>
	<p><b>The Pensions strand of the Open Method of Coordination (EU) is governed by three main objectives - adequate, sustainable, modernised</b><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> 
	<br>(not as comprehensive as above mentioned but could be a good data reference)</p>
	<p>Primary indicators for <u>Adequate</u>:</p> 
	<ul> 
		<li>At-risk-of-poverty rate of elderly people, (65+)</li> 
		<li>Median relative income ratio of elderly people, (65+)</li> 
		<li>Aggregate replacement ratio (excluding other social benefits)</li> 
	</ul> 
	<p>Primary indicators for <u>Sustainable</u>:</p> 
	<ul> 
		<li>Total Current Pension expenditure (% of GDP)</li> 
		<li>Employment rate of older workers</li> 
		<li>Duration of working life</li> 
	</ul> 
	<p>Primary indicators for <u>Modernised</u>:</p> 
	<ul> 
		<li>Gender differences in the at-risk-of-poverty rate of elderly people</li> 
		<li>Gender differences in the relative median income ratio of elderly people</li> 
		<li>Gender differences in the aggregate replacement ratio</li> 
	</ul>

	<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Notes </h4>
	<p><a href="#ref1" id="fn1">1.</a> The amount of an adequate, minimum income from pillar 0 depends on family structures within a society and must be defined relative to living standards of rest of society (20-33% is the international norm)</p>
	<p><a href="#ref2" id="fn2">2.</a> According to World Bank, a target of 50-60% for an average earner is appropriate</p>
	<p><a href="#ref3" id="fn3">3.</a> A modernised pension system is transparent, well adapted to the needs and aspirations of women and men and the requirements of modern societies, demographic ageing and structural change; 
	it also ensures that people receive the information they need to plan their retirement and that reforms are conducted on the basis of the broadest possible consensus</p>
