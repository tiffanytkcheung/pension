  		<li>A steady stream of lifelong retirement income</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>A comprehensive saving system with 4 accounts serving different needs:</h2>

  		</li>
	</ul>

	<br>Mandatory contribution ranges from 12.5% to 37% and are allocated to different accounts. Both rates are depending on contributor's age. The split of contribution by employers and employees also varies with age.

	</p>

	<h2>Investment and Return</h2>
	<p>CPF savings (that are not used for individual investments) managed by CPF Board are invested in Special Singapore Government Securities (non-tradable bonds issued specifically for CPF savings) 
	which are guaranteed by the Government to pay interest, the rate is reviewed quarterly.
	<br>The proceeds from SSGS issuance are invested by the government via MAS and GIC.
	<br>Investment is not linked to employment; employees have full control over their money, which is refer to as "full portability"
