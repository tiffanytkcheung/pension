	<h2><u>Financial Literacy in HK (IFEC report in 2021)</u> <sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></h2>
	<p>Individual's financial literacy is often evaluated by asking three questions about fundamental financial knowledge (compound interest, inflation, and risk diversification). IFEC report uses a more comprehensive approach suggested by OECD covering attitude and behaviour as well.</p>

	<details>
	<summary><h3>Financial knowledge</h3></summary>
	<ul>
		<li>Better understanding of basic financial concepts such as compounding effect and risk diversification especially among the younger segment (Students scored this highest, followed by Young working adults).</li>
		<li>Majority consider their financial knowledge level at average; slightly more confidence among the Mature working adults and Pre-Retirees.
		<ul>
			<li>Financial knowledge score of self-rated high group is not much higher than self-rated average group.</li>
			<li>More divergence was found in inflation concept, compound interest and risk diversification.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</details>
	<details>
	<summary><h3>Financial attitude</h3></summary> 
	<ul> 
		<li>Planning
		<ul>
			<li>25% of surveyed respondents have adopted a "live for today and let tomorrow take care of itself" attitude and found it less gratifying to save money for the long term.</li> 
		</ul>
		</li> 
		<li>Learning
		<ul>
			<li>Working adults active in their careers are particularly engaged in proactively seeking information about money management; retirees are least interested in financial learning (41% totally not interested).</li> 
		</ul>
		</li> 
	</ul> 
	</details>
	<details>
	<summary><h3>Financial behavior</h3></summary> 
	<ul> 
		<li>Day-to-day financial management
		<ul>
			<li>The proportion of retirees who agreed that they keep a close eye on their financial affairs, keep money for bills, and make plans for income and spending is significantly less than mature working adults and pre-retirees.</li> 
		</ul>
		</li> 
		<li>Saving
		<ul>
			<li>Less than half (47%) reported having set and acted towards long-term goals, down from 54% in 2019 (more so among mature adults aged over 30).</li> 
			<li>More active saving behavior among young people, likely spurred on by more stay-at-home and prevalence of digital trading apps (young working adults: 28% in 2023, compared to 15% in 2019; students: 18% in 2023, compared to 2% in 2019).</li> 
			<li>None in the younger segments and a small proportion (16%) of mature working adults have their primary saving goal on retirement preparation; buying property seemed to be a more pressing issue. 
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://institute.hkcss.org.hk/downloads/ES_A07.pdf">The HKCSS survey</a> reveals that "saving for a rainy day" is the primary reason for developing saving habits, while making ends meet is the main reason for not having a saving habit.</li> 
			</ul>
			</li> 
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Holding financial products
		<ul>
			<li>Insurance products were not common among retirees (43%, compared to 83% of pre-retirees); only 4% hold annuities.</li>
			<li>Young working adults tend to rely more on MPF savings compared to mature working adults to support retirement.</li> 
			<li>Saving life insurance as a source of retirement funding is more common among mature working adults.</li> 
		</ul>
		</li> 
		<li>Retirement confidence
		<ul>
			<li>Retirement confidence of mature working adults dropped during the pandemic, probably due to a decrease in income and pressure on taking care of parents and children.</li> 
		</ul>

		<li><b>Retirement goal clarity explained the effects of financial literacy on intentions to purchase other saving products</b> in the commercial market.

	<summary><h3>Overview of financial literacy around the world <sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup></h3></summary>
	<p><u>Key observations (in general, with exceptions):</u></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Answering <b>one additional financial question correctly is associated with a 3-4 percentage point higher probability of planning for retirement</b> in countries as diverse as Germany, the USA, Japan, and Sweden (same pattern observed in other countries but the degree of association varies).
		<ul>
			<li>Even after accounting for factors such as education, marital status, number of children, retirement status, race, and sex, similar result is still obtained. The research also pointed out that <b>lack of planning is tantamount to lack of saving</b>. <sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Where people score well on mathematics and science tests, they also tend to score well on questions measuring numeracy (i.e. compound interest)</li>
		<li>People are more knowledgeable about <b>inflation</b> if their country has <b>experienced it recently</b>.</li>
		<li>People are more knowledgeable about <b>risk diversification</b> if the country has experienced <b>pension privatization</b>.</li>
		<li><b>Women</b> (across nations, education, income level) are less likely to answer correctly and also <b>more likely to indicate that they "do not know"</b> the answer which may result from <b><a href="#lack">lack of confidence</a> in financial knowledge</b> rather than lack of actual knowledge. <sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup>
		<ul>
			<li>Study shows that <b>financial literacy is associated with pension participation</b>.<sup><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> However, in Japan, women are more likely to engage with retirement planning than men despite their lower level of financial knowledge.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b id="edu_finlit">Higher educational attainment is strongly correlated with financial knowledge</b>, but even at the highest level of schooling, financial literacy tends to be low.</li>
		<li>Age, income, socio-economic status, engagement in workforce, ethnicity, religious beliefs, sibilings' financial conditions (worse &rarr; more literate), experience of large wealth losses are also factors affecting financial literacy in some countries.</li>
	</ul>
	**<u>Interesting point mentioned in the paper</u>**
	<p>Consider the following 2 questions:
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Buying a company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund. True or false?</li>
		<li>Buying a stock mutual fund usually provides a safer return than a company stock. True or false? </li>
	</ol>
	The answers do appear <b>sensitive to how the question is worded</b> in both the US American Life Panel and the Dutch DNB Household Survey (DHS). Fewer people answer correctly with (b) and correct responses double with (a). <b>Acquiescence bias</b> - <a href="https://www.quantilope.com/resources/acquiescence-bias">tendency to give the 'expected' response instead of true preference</a> when answering questions that reflect on personality and behaviour - could be a possible explanation.</p>
	</details>

	<details>
	<summary><h3>Biased financial literacy perception & retirement planning behaviour <sup><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup></h3></summary>
	<p>Mismatches between actual and self-assessed financial knowledge was observed in many countries including Australia, US, UK, Germany and China. It is suggested that consumer overconfidence regarding their financial knowledge may be a deterrent to seeking out professional advice, thus widening the 'knowledge gap'.</p>
	<p id="lack">The study in China states that respondents who are <b>over (under) confidence in their financial knowledge have a higher (lower) propensity to plan and take actual actions</b> for retirement. This echoes the result found in another paper where <b>misinformed individuals are as responsive as the well-informed to perceived pension information</b> even though their behaviour would be based on incorrect information; uninformed individuals are simply unresponsive. <sup><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup></p>
	</details>

	<details>
	<summary><h3>Longevity literacy & Financial literacy <sup><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup></h3></summary>
	<ul>
		<li>Longevity literacy is highly correlated with financial literacy, i.e., those with greater financial literacy more often demonstrate strong longevity knowledge.</li>
		<li>A greater tendency among individuals with <b>strong longevity knowledge to be future-oriented and retirement-ready</b> compared to those with poor longevity knowledge.</li>
		<li>The ultimate outcome being that those with <b>high financial literacy tend to have a better financial experience in retirement</b> i.e. easy to make ends meet, retirement lifestyle exceeds or meets pre-retirement expectations.</li>
	</ul>
	</details>

	<details>
	<summary><h3>Retirement planning - UK & Japan <sup><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup></h3></h3></summary>
	<p>More than half of respondents from UK and Japan reported not understanding how much they needed to save (compared to 23% in HK), the survey suggested these reasons:
	<ul>
		<li>varied retirement plans offered by employers, majority are invested in a default investment option &rarr; employees do not manage their own money</li>
		<li>different state pension benefits</li>
		<li>changes to retirement ages</li>
		<li>the vast choice of personal savings options </li>
		<li>lack of education and guidance
		<ul>
			<li>young workers in Japan (and Canada) have significanly lower estimated contribution rates to state pension and earlier retirement age which is not realistic.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><u>Financial Education</u></h2>
	
	<details>
	<summary><h3>Situation in HK (HKCSS survey on 2015) <sup><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup></h3></summary>
	<ul>
		<li>One-third of respondents said they had received some financial education in school (higher proportion is observed in younger age group), mostly about daily expense management.</li>
		<li>Friends and colleagues is the most common source of acquiring financial knowledge after graduation, followed by traditional media; ~50% said they acquired knowledge about investment product and MPF portfolio.</li>
		<li>Majority of respondents don't have a habit of formulating budget.</li>
		<li>~30% were not engage in investment, partly due to lack of knowledge.</li>
		<li>Aged 30-34 (they entered the job market when MPF was first implemented) shows a slightly different pattern:

			<img src="handle_mpf_change_job.PNG" alt="how to handle mpf benefit when job changed" width="480" height="250">
		</li>
	</ul>
	</details>

	<details>
	<summary><h3>Effectiveness of financial education</h3></summary>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Program embed follow-up or are continued over time</b>, so as to help employees retain knowledge acquired via the program are found <b>more effective</b>.<sup><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup>
		<ul> 
			<li>Long-term financial education delivered to employees around the age of 40 will optimally enhance savings at retirement by close to 10%.</li> 
			<li>Programs that provide one-time education can generate short-term but few long-term effects. Even participants expressed higher intent to change saving behaviour, the effect on actual actions is very limited. <sup><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup></li> 
		</ul> 
		</li> 
		<li><a href="https://pensionresearchcouncil.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WP-2015-02-Lusardi-Michaud-OSM.pdf">Low participation rates</a> can be rational as improving financial literacy does not benefit everyone and acquiring knowledge is costly.
		<ul> 
			<li>The <b>low-income and less-educated have less to gain</b> from participating in such programs.</li> 
		</ul> 
		</li> 
		<li>Context effects in retirement preparation<sup><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup>: whether pension communication induces individuals to get involved and change their behavior strongly depends upon the <b>presentation and wording of the message</b> rather than its objective content (non-neutrality of language, e.g. gender marketing). <sup><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup>
		<ul> 
			<li>More examples in "<a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2016/number/3/article/financial-literacy-and-preparation-for-retirement.html">Box 2</a>" - individuals with low financial literacy benefit more from <a href="https://raymondduch.com/files/choice-architecture-improves-pension-selection.pdf"><b>choice architecture</b></a>. <sup><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup></li> 
		</ul> 
		</li> 
		<li>Financial advisors (human-based is preferred by most) are viewed as the most important source of education and advice. <sup><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup></li> </li>
