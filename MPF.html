	<h2>Current Situation of MPF enrolment (as of March 2023):<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></h2>
	<div style="text-align: center;">

	</div>
	<p>Among the 13% who are not required to join any retirement schemes, most of them are domestic workers or employees aged below 18 or above 65. 
	According C&SD employment statistics, there were 6,600M unpaid family workers in the employed population.</p>


	<h2>Major Strengths of MPF<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></h2>
	<ol>
  		<li>A clearly defined objective and purpose</li>
  		<li>Wide coverage of Hong Kong's working population</li>
  		<li>Relatively high level of transparency</li>
  		<li>Flexible scheme structure</li>
  		<li>Immediate vesting of MPF mandatory contributions</li>
  		<li>Segregated custody of MPF assets by qualified custodians</li>
  		<li>Comprehensive regulation and oversight provided by the MPFA</li>
  		<li>Defined-contribution scheme avoids the problem of making unsustainable benefit promises, and minimizes distortions in the labour market 
		(<a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2002/11/cj22n2-8.pdf">MPF study by Alan Siu</a>, 2002)</li>
  		<li>The range of investment choices is similar to that found in more mature retirement systems, but does come at a cost in terms of relatively higher fund management fees as a percentage of assets under management

		<li>
		<details>
		<summary>MPF mandatory contributions alone are inadequate to fund a reasonable retirement</summary>
		<ul>
			<li>The current maximum RI of HK$30,000 a month shows that the system is heavily focused towards those on the bottom rungs of the salary ladder
			<ul>
				<li>Low-paid workers are not able to save enough with only 10% of their monthly salary</li>
				<li>Well-paid workers' contribution is capped at $1500 which is not enough for proper retirement as well (in terms of replacement rate)</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Many experts believe that employees need to save at least 20% of their compensation to maintain the same standard of living pre- and post-retirement</li>
			<li>Singapore CPF requires 37% contribution; Germany 18.6%; Iceland 21.9%</li>
			<li>Catch-up contributions are available in US and Singapore for old age/families with children</li>
			<li>Current replacement rate is around 40%, much less than other jurisdictions with top pension systems e.g. Iceland, Denmark, Netherlands which have replacement rate over 75%</li>
			<li>The anxiety about the inadequacy of retirement income sources and financial circumstances that they expect to deteriorate once retired have prompted many to postpone retirement - extending withdrawal age?</li>

			<li>Many housewives who were previously employees but have already left the labour market or undertaking caring responsibilities that lead to interrupted work histories

	<summary><strong>Critiques on pay-as-you-go system</strong></summary>
	<ul> 
		<li> A comprehensive pension system has three important functions: saving, redistribution, and insurance. The PAYG system found in many countries often combines the three functions into a single program and is often organized as a Ponzi scheme:
		<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(...) Everyone who reaches retirement age is given benefit privileges that far exceed anything he has paid in. It stems from the fact that the national product is growing at compound interest and can be expected to do so for as far ahead as the eye cannot see. 
		Always there are more youths than old folks in a growing population.</p></li> 
		<li> Even though the benefit formulas are seemingly progressive, the amount of redistribution is often limited because the rich enter the labor force later and tend to live longer. </li> 
		<li> Slower growth and financial market volatility (and increasing unemployment in some countries) are challenges for maintaining <a href="https://www.hkeconomy.gov.hk/en/pdf/wp/PAYG.pdf">financial sustainability of pension systems</a>.</li> 
		<li> Reduces saving incentives and brings adverse impact on future economic development (see <a href="#image3">pension debt in other economies</a>). <sup><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup>

		<li> The appropriate generosity of the PAYG system needs to reflect a country's political culture and, in particular, the acceptability of different levels of taxation and compulsory contribution. <sup><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup></li>

	<summary><strong>Critiques on means-tested welfare program</strong></summary>
	<ul> 
		<li>Create a major disincentive for low- and middle-income workers to save on top of their mandatory contributions for their retirement. It also discourages older workers to continue working after attaining the retirement age.</li>
		<li>It can be inequitable. Suppose two workers, A and B, have the same lifetime earnings. Worker A does not save for retirement and consumes all his disposable income, while worker B saves by investing in his children. Worker B's children would wind up supporting the retirement of both A and B.</li>

	<h3><a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-annual-chairmans-letter">Chairman annual letter to investors</a> about retirement investment (Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Even in wealthier countries, many people lack the ability to save; and if they do save, they often use those savings for an emergency, rather than investing for retirement. In some countries people are actually over saving but under-investing. 
		If they are keeping their money in the bank rather than investing in the market, they won't generate the returns necessary to retire with dignity.
		<ul>
			<li>67% Hong Kong people have saving habit, among that, only 27% save for retirement. Over 70% put their savings as demand/time deposits <sup><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup></li>
			<li>Having insufficient income is the major hindrance of not saving</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Long-term investing requires trust in the financial system and a fundamental belief that tomorrow will be better than today.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Public opinions on retirement protection <sup><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Some views reflected that some elderly persons, despite having accumulated $100 000 to over $1 million in savings, were still worried because they did not have a stable monthly income. (...) it is worried that limited savings may not be enough 
		to cope with the expenses for retirement life as long as tens of years and other various unforeseeable expenses particularly medical expenses.
		<ul>
			<li>It was not common for elderly persons to buy health insurance for themselves. Their medical expenses were mainly paid by their savings or their children. It was clear that those who were covered by medical insurance believed they had a more stable retirement life.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>There were views suggesting that the eligibility for additional allowance should be based on other criteria, such as seven years of residence in Hong Kong, having worked in Hong Kong for a certain period of time, having paid tax, or other non-asset related criteria.</li>
		<li>Most proposals disregard self-owned properties from the means test, but some proposals set limits for self-owned properties. Individual proposals include additional assessment criteria such as rental expenses, family and health status, etc.</li>
		<li>Ageing parents and delayed childbearing cause financial pressure on retirees as they are still the breadwinners of their families (incomes decrease while expenses remain more or less the same)</li>
