	<h2 style="text-align: center";>Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (Since 1998)</h2>

	<h3>Mission</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>To regulate and supervise privately managed provident fund schemes.</li>
		<li>To educate the working population about saving for retirement and the role of the MPF System as one of the pillars supporting retirement living.</li>
		<li>To lead improvements to provident fund schemes to make them more efficient and user-friendly, and better meet the needs of the working population.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Original intent</h3>
	<p>MPFA was established to build a retirement saving system for Hong kong people as well as to reduce fiscal pressure due to ageing population.
	<br>MPFA is not legislator but they continue to lobby with the government and legislators for better policies to be implemented. </p>

	<h3>Achievements (as of 2020)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>87% (2020) working population got retirement protection (before MPF implementation in 2000, only one-third was covered).</li>
		<li>MPF has a total asset of over 1 trillion Hong Kong dollars.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Development Milestone</h3>

	<h4>1 June 2022</h4>
	<p>The legislative amendments to facilitate MPF investment in debt securities issued or unconditionally guaranteed by the Central People¡¦s Government,

	<h4>1 May 2025</h4>
